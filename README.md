Hi! I'm a software developer who loves coding and creating useful tools. Iâ€™ve learned C, C++, and Java, and I understand Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Right now, Iâ€™m learning web development.

I enjoy making modern web systems that help people and businesses. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and use them to solve real problems.

Letâ€™s connect and see how we can work together on interesting projects!
